Write a method that checks if a string is anagram of another string, that is, it is built out of the same letters as another string:
 Examples:
    isAnagram("abca","caba"); -> true   aabc aabc
    isAnagram("abc","abb"); -> false
    isAnagram("listen","silent"); -> true
    isAnagram("bored","robed"); -> true
    isAnagram("night","thing"); -> true
    isAnagram("stressed","desserts"); -> true
    isAnagram("cola","loco"); -> false
